I was interested in learning new things such as **shader nodes** in blender 3.0, for example i  used **bump mapping** in the material node editor for the red metallic shell of the motorbike.

## Gundam mecha head

This is one of my first projects, i learnt **subdivision surfaces** in order to render smoother meshes and i enjoyed it a lot!
